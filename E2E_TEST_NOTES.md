# E2E Test - Implementation Summary

## What Was Accomplished

Successfully updated the end-to-end test to include a complete round-trip data flow:
**Redpanda → Iceberg → DuckDB → Redpanda**

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`duckdb/query_and_publish.py`** (NEW)
   - Queries Iceberg table using DuckDB Python library
   - Aggregates trade statistics by symbol
   - Publishes results back to Redpanda (`trade_analytics` topic)

2. **`validation/e2e.sh`** (UPDATED)
   - Complete automated test from start to finish
   - Now includes DuckDB querying and publishing step
   - Verifies data made it back to Redpanda

3. **`README.md`** (UPDATED)
   - Added complete round-trip architecture diagram
   - Updated Quick Start section with automated test instructions
   - Added manual step-by-step guide
   - Updated architecture and features sections

4. **`duckdb-ui/Dockerfile`** (UPDATED)
   - Added Python 3 and pip
   - Installed `duckdb` and `confluent-kafka` Python packages

5. **`docker-compose.yml`** (UPDATED)
   - Fixed duckdb-cli service to not call `start_ui()` (causes segfault in headless mode)

## How to Run the E2E Test

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- 8-10 minutes of time

### Method 1: Clean Docker Reset (Recommended)

If you encounter Docker networking issues, do a full reset:

```bash
# Stop all Docker containers
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)

# Remove all containers and networks
docker system prune -af

# Navigate to project
cd rp-e2e-nospark

# Run the e2e test
./validation/e2e.sh
```

### Method 2: Quick Run (If Docker is Clean)

```bash
cd rp-e2e-nospark
./validation/e2e.sh
```

## What the E2E Test Does

1. **Step 1:** Starts all services (Redpanda, MinIO, Iceberg catalog, committer, DuckDB)
2. **Step 2:** Creates topics (`trades` and `trade_analytics`)
3. **Step 3:** Produces 50,000 trade records to Redpanda
4. **Step 4:** Runs Redpanda Connect to stream data to S3 and then Iceberg
5. **Step 5:** Verifies Iceberg table with DuckDB queries
6. **Step 6:** **NEW** - Queries Iceberg with DuckDB and publishes aggregated analytics to Redpanda
7. **Step 7:** **NEW** - Verifies analytics were published to `trade_analytics` topic
8. **Step 8:** Shows summary statistics

## Expected Output

```
=== End-to-End Test PASSED ===
✓ Data successfully flowed through complete pipeline:
  1. Producer -> Redpanda (trades topic)
  2. Redpanda Connect -> MinIO S3 (NDJSON staging)
  3. Committer -> Iceberg table (Parquet files)
  4. DuckDB -> Query Iceberg table
  5. DuckDB -> Redpanda (trade_analytics topic)
```

## Known Issues

### Docker Networking Issue on macOS
There's a known issue with Docker Desktop on macOS where stale network references can cause:
```
Error response from daemon: failed to set up container networking: network <ID> not found
```

**Solution:** Run `docker system prune -af` before running the e2e test.

### DuckDB UI Segfault
The DuckDB `start_ui()` function causes a segmentation fault in headless Docker containers.
Fixed by removing the UI startup command from docker-compose.yml.

## Testing the Round-Trip Manually

If you want to test just the DuckDB → Redpanda step:

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up -d redpanda minio catalog committer duckdb-cli

# Produce data and wait for it to reach Iceberg (see README for full steps)
# ...

# Run the DuckDB query and publish script
docker compose exec \
  -e RP_BROKERS=redpanda:9092 \
  -e RP_TOPIC_RESULTS=trade_analytics \
  duckdb-cli python3 /workspace/duckdb/query_and_publish.py

# Verify results in Redpanda
docker compose exec redpanda rpk topic consume trade_analytics --num 10 --format json
```

## Architecture

The complete data flow:

1. **Producer** generates 50K deterministic trade records
2. **Redpanda** receives on `trades` topic
3. **Redpanda Connect** batches and writes NDJSON to MinIO S3
4. **Committer** converts NDJSON → Parquet → Iceberg table
5. **DuckDB** queries Iceberg Parquet files directly
6. **DuckDB** aggregates by symbol and publishes to `trade_analytics` topic
7. **Verification** consumes from `trade_analytics` to confirm round-trip

## Future Enhancements

- Add more complex analytical queries
- Support partitioned Iceberg tables
- Add Grafana dashboards for monitoring
- Implement incremental processing
